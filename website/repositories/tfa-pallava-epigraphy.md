# Pallava Epigraphy

This [repository](/texts?q=repo%3Atfa-pallava-epigraphy) of approximately **550** inscriptions contains the inscriptions of the Pallava dynasty (4th-9th century, South India). It is based on the corpus constituted by T.V. Mahalingam (*Inscriptions of the Pallavas* [IP], New Delhi, 1988) made of 375 inscriptions. This corpus is supplemented with inscriptions found after this publication, for instance those collected by D. Dayalan, (*Computer Application in Indian Epigraphy (Pallava Period)*, New Delhi, 2005).

An inscription is here considered a Pallava inscription if it dates from the Pallava period (4th to 9th century approximately) and comes from an area which was under the Pallava rule at this time.
