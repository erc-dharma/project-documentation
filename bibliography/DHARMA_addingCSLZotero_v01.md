# Adding a new CSL file in Zotero

A CSL stylesheet exports bibliographic items according a set of rules following, e.g. Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition (author-date).

## Choosing a CSL from Zotero Database
You can use any CSL already added in the Zotero Database. To do so,
- Open the Zotero standalone
- click-on Zotero > Preferences... in the toolbar
- Choose the Cite tab > Styles
- Click on `Get additional styles...`under the Style Manager list
- Use the search bar to look after a precise style
- Once you have found it, just click on it to add it to your settings.

## Adding DHARMA Modified CSL
Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition (author-date) has been updated to support years range.
- First download the file :   `chicago-author-dateModified.csl`
- You can store it anywhere you want in your computer, but if you move it, the steps to link it with Zotero will have to be done again. For now, we recommend storing it inside your Zotero directory. By default, this directory is at the root of the user.
  - Put the file in YourUsername > Zotero > styles
- Open the Zotero standalone
- click-on Zotero > Preferences... in the toolbar
- Choose the Cite tab > Styles
- Click on the `+` button at the right under the Style Manager list
- Select the `chicago-author-dateModified.csl` you have previously stored in YourUsername > Zotero > styles and enter.
- This new style will appear in the style Manager list under `DHARMA Modified - Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition (author-date)`

## Using a Style from the Standalone
To use a style to export an item, right- click on the item and choose `Create Bibliography from item`. You can select your style and your output method and mode.
You can also apply such an export to a collection.

## Using Text Processors Plugins
Plugins are available for Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, and Google Docs.
To create dynamic bibliographies: insert a new in-text citation in your manuscript, and the bibliography will be automatically updated to include the cited item. The style can be selected from the Document preferences.
